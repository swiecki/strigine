# Strigine

Strigine is a compact, borderless, and resizeable YouTube player used for watching videos in small section of your screen. By default, YouTube doesn't work well in a small browser window. Strigine removes the YouTube header, sidebar, and browser frame, resulting in a compact player that fits perfectly on your desktop.
